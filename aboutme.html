        <b> My name is Ashur Morris, I am on a mission to become the best me and I work on myself everyday to make that happen. I really want to be successful but to do that I cannot just rely on faith I have to work for it. These things I desire are just dream without any goals behind them so that why I map out my plans and have some type of objective. Don't be lazy or lack ambition because you will not get anywhere in life. If you know your purpose and know what you want to do just know its not going to be easy all of the time just, but don't quit because you failed everyone fails you cannot run from it its evitable.   </b>

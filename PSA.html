        <h1> Save Children from Child Abuse and Neglect </h1>
        
        
        <p> Many people have noticed that parents are starting to get more frustrated with with their lives and are taking it out on their children. Parents start to under think their actions and instead of disciplining their children, they are abusing their children. There are many precautions that should be taken when dealing with situations like these. Many experiments can be done in order to determine if abuse is taking place in the home. In order to determine child abuse, authorities usually look for bruises or broken bones in bad families but child abuse is determined by factors that are sometimes unknown. </p>

        <p> What if a child discloses abuse to me?
 
DO;</p>

        <p> Provide a safe environment (be comforting, welcoming, and a good listener).</p>
        <p>Tell the child it was not his/her fault.</p>
        <p>Listen carefully.</p>
        
        <p>Document the child’s exact quotes.</p>
        <p>Be supportive, not judgmental.</p>
        <p>Know your limits.</p>
        <p>Tell the truth and make no promises.</p>
<b>DO NOT</b>

<p>Investigate – leave this to the professionals.
Ask leading questions (a question that suggests the answer or contains the information the questioner is looking for – That man touched you, didn’t he?).</p>
        <p>Make promises.</p>
        <p>Notify the parents or the caretaker.</p>
 
<b>Ask ONLY four questions:</b>

        <p>What happened?</p>
        <p>Who did this to you?</p>
        <p>Where were you when this happened?</p>
        <p>When did this happen?</p>
